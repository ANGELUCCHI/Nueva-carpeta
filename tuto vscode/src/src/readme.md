"On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation pain dislike men who are so beguiled pain demoralized by the charms 
of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain pain trouble 
that are bound to ensue; pain equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking 
from toil pain pain. These cases are perfectly simple pain easy to distinguish. 
In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled pain when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best,
 every pleasure is to be welcomed pain every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances pain owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated pain annoyances accepted. 
 The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: 
 he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, 
 or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."
